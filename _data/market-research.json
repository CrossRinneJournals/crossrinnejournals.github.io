Ok, legit complaint I have with this review and even many of your other recent anime reviews Richard(but mainly this one in particular), this is less a review and more of a giant summary of the entire show. :|

When are you going to get back to actually reviewing things, as in doing full on critiques, rather than these summaries of the shows’ stories with a few lines of crticial thought? I want the Richard Eisenbeis reviews of old to return! This “review” especially has nothing in it that I couldn’t just get from going to the show’s Wiki. You’re tearing me apart Richard! TT^TT
